# Heart Disease Prediction Model
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file that implements a machine learning model for predicting heart disease. The model is built using Python and various libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn and uses Logistic Regression model.

## Dataset

- The model is trained on the [Heart Disease Prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset).
- The dataset consists of various medical features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and presence of heart disease.

## Notebook

- The Jupyter Notebook file for the heart disease prediction model can be found [here](https://github.com/AryanKaushal2002/Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model/blob/main/Heart%20Disease%20Prediction%20model/Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb).
- The notebook provides a step-by-step guide on loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

## Usage

To use this model, follow these steps:

1. Download the [Heart Disease Prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset).
2. Place the dataset file in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook file.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file.
4. Run the notebook cells to load the data, preprocess it, train the model, and make predictions.

## Requirements

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results

The model's performance can be evaluated using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are displayed within the Jupyter Notebook.
